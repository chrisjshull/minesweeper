Please package your solution as a .zip or .tar.gz file, with all source code and a readme with instructions to run it. Include a paragraph describing your architectural, framework, and design decisions and anything else you’d like us to know when trying it. Tell us how to run the app!

We aim for a puzzle to take at most a few hours. If you find it is taking too long, just do your best to write a minimal, functional piece of code that we can read, understand, and try out.

You should use client-side JavaScript for your solution. You don’t need to support all browsers, but please support one of: Firefox, Chrome, or Safari. Mention what platform/browser you’ve tested it on.
